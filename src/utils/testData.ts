        code: "for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);\n}",
        expectedOutput: "3\n3\n3", 
        explanation: "The `var` keyword creates a function-scoped variable, and `i` is mutable. By the time `setTimeout` callbacks execute (after the loop finishes), the value of `i` has already become 3. All three closures reference the same `i` which now holds 3."

        question: "You need to render a list of 10,000 items efficiently in a browser. Each item has a complex structure and rendering all at once causes performance issues. How would you approach this to ensure a smooth user experience?",
        idealSolution: "The primary approach to efficiently render large lists is **Virtualization (or Windowing)**. This technique only renders the items currently visible in the user's viewport, plus a small buffer of items above and below the viewport. As the user scrolls, new items are rendered and old, off-screen items are unmounted or recycled. This significantly reduces the number of DOM elements that the browser needs to manage, improving performance.",
        keyConsiderations: [
          "**Virtualization Libraries:** Use existing libraries like `react-window`, `react-virtualized` (for React), `vue-virtual-scroller` (for Vue), or custom implementations.",
          "**Item Height:** Fixed vs. dynamic item heights. Fixed heights are simpler to implement; dynamic heights require more complex calculations to determine item positions and visible range.",
          "**Scroll Position:** Accurately calculating which items are visible based on scroll position and container height.",
          "**Placeholder Elements:** Using placeholder elements to maintain scrollbar size and prevent jumpiness.",
          "**Data Management:** Ensuring efficient data access for the visible items.",
          "**Performance Tuning:** Debouncing scroll events, optimizing individual item rendering, avoiding unnecessary re-renders."
